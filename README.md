# Krunker Cheat Exposing
So theres a new krunker cheat that has been released on github and on the google extensions, but this included a trojan or a stealer, if you look closely to background.js, you cant see nothing but if you go on https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/ and put "funkos" code on there you can put it in array deobfuscation mode, if you look after the funcs will be deobfuscated, not all but neededs. 
He uses a function called getCookie, which is susp beacause alot of hackers use cookies, and my friend used it on a vm and it didnt go well for the vm, so dont download that shit, well its your choice but i dont recommend you to, beacause i saw alot of people get their account stolen
